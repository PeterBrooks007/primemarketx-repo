                of instruments to explore and trade, each catering to diverse
                goals, risk appetites, and investment strategies. Here&apos;s a

                Stocks <br />
                Stocks represent ownership in a company and are one of the most
                common and accessible investment options. Traders can profit
                from price movements in the stock market or earn dividends from
                long-term holdings. With global exchanges offering shares from
                various sectors, investors can build diverse portfolios aligned
                with their risk and return objectives.

                operate on blockchain technology and offer unique opportunities

                market is known for its volatility, presenting significant
                potential returns but also heightened risk.
